I can't see filtering results of the Guard Duty service  on my account. But base on my knowledge I can describe the result as below:

# Findings detected
  - Issue type: UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce
  - Two findings
    1. Attack Instance is performing SSH brute force attacks against Web Service Instance
    2. Web Service Instance is under attack

# AWS Guard Duty's source of information
  - Guard Duty performs scanning on network traffic
  - SSH bruteforce attacks are found by scanning traffic in and out of port 22.
