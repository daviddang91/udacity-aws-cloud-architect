1. To prevent SSH brute force attack
  - Disable SSH login via password for the web service instance
  - Update the WebAppSG to allow requests only from the load balancer
  - Use AWS system manager instead of ssh directly
  - Move the web service instance into the private subnet


2. Enable server side encryption for S3 buckets with a KMS key and assign to privileged business users only.
